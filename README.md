This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project called Star Wars App bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Tests

The project includes unit tests for the main components and logic of the application.

To run the tests, follow these steps:

Install the dependencies if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

The tests are configured to avoid making real API requests during execution. Instead, they use mock data.
